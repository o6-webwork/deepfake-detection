# 🔍 Deepfake Detection VLM

A Streamlit-based web application for detecting AI-generated content using Vision Language Models (VLMs). This tool provides a user-friendly interface for analyzing images and videos to determine if they contain AI-generated or deepfake content.

## Features

### 🎯 Core Functionality
- **Multi-format Support**: Analyze images (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP) and videos (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV)
- **Individual Analysis**: Each uploaded file gets analyzed separately with dedicated result sections
- **2-Step Classification Process**:
  1. Detailed analysis of visual artifacts and inconsistencies
  2. Binary classification based on the analysis (Real vs AI Generated)
- **Real-time Results**: Live progress indicators and immediate feedback

### 🔧 Configuration
- **Dynamic Endpoint Configuration**: Connect to any vLLM deployment via sidebar
- **Model Selection**: Automatically load and select from available models at the endpoint
- **Temperature Control**: Adjust model creativity/determinism (0.0 - 2.0)
- **Custom Prompts**: Modify analysis prompts and assistant response prefills

### 📊 Data Export
- **CSV Export**: Download comprehensive analysis results including:
  - Filename and metadata
  - Endpoint URL and model name
  - User prompt and assistant prefill
  - Temperature setting
  - Full analysis text
  - Classification result
  - Raw classification response
  - Timestamp

### 🐛 Debug Features
- **Raw Response Viewer**: Expandable sections showing complete VLM outputs
- **Step-by-step Tracking**: Separate debug info for analysis and classification steps
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for API failures

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Access to a vLLM deployment with vision capabilities

### Setup

1. **Clone or download the project files**

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Starting the Application

1. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run deepfake_detector.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser** to the displayed URL (typically `http://localhost:8501`)

### Configuration

1. **Configure Endpoint** (Sidebar):
   - Enter your vLLM endpoint URL (e.g., `http://100.64.0.3:8001`)
   - Click "🔄 Load Models" to fetch available models
   - Select your preferred model from the dropdown

2. **Customize Analysis** (Main Panel):
   - Modify the user prompt to focus on specific detection criteria
   - Adjust the assistant response prefill to guide analysis structure
   - Set temperature for response consistency (0.0 = deterministic)

### Analyzing Content

1. **Upload Files**: Use the file uploader to select images or videos
2. **Review Settings**: Ensure your prompt, prefill, and temperature are configured
3. **Start Analysis**: Click "🔍 Analyze for Deepfakes"
4. **Review Results**: Each file displays:
   - Classification (Real/AI Generated)
   - Detailed analysis explanation
   - Debug information (expandable)

### Exporting Results

- Click "📥 Download CSV Report" in the Export Results section
- CSV includes all analysis data with timestamp for record-keeping

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Streamlit web interface
- **Backend**: Direct integration with vLLM OpenAI-compatible API
- **Analysis Pipeline**: Two-step process for improved accuracy
  1. Vision analysis with custom prompts
  2. Text-based classification of the analysis

### API Integration
- Compatible with any vLLM deployment using OpenAI API format
- Automatic endpoint discovery via `/v1/models`
- Support for both image+text and text-only API calls

### Video Processing
- Automatic frame extraction from video files
- Configurable frame sampling (default: 5 frames per video)
- Each frame analyzed as individual image

## Dependencies

```
streamlit>=1.28.0
requests>=2.31.0
Pillow>=10.0.0
opencv-python>=4.8.0
pandas>=2.0.0
```

## Configuration Examples

### Typical vLLM Endpoints
- Local deployment: `http://localhost:8000`
- Remote server: `http://your-server-ip:8001`
- Cloud deployment: `https://your-endpoint.com`

### Recommended Models
- **MiniCPM-V series**: Good balance of speed and accuracy
- **LLaVA models**: Strong vision understanding capabilities
- **Qwen-VL models**: Multilingual support

### Prompt Examples

**Basic Detection**:
```
Is this image real or AI-generated?
```

**Detailed Analysis**:
```
Analyze this image for signs of AI generation. Look for artifacts like:
- Unnatural lighting or shadows
- Inconsistent textures
- Facial anomalies
- Background inconsistencies
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to load models"**:
- Check that the endpoint URL is correct
- Ensure the vLLM server is running and accessible
- Verify network connectivity

**"API call failed"**:
- Confirm the selected model supports vision tasks
- Check server logs for detailed error information
- Verify the endpoint has sufficient resources

**Slow analysis**:
- Reduce image resolution before upload
- Lower the max_tokens parameter in the code
- Use a smaller/faster model

## Contributing
